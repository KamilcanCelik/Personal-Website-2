#### [You can click here for the link to the site.](https://cristiano-ronaldo.vercel.app/)


This project was my third project. In this project, I changed the Frontend of my second project, leaving the Backend the same. The purpose of this project was the same as my second project, that is, after making a Web Site for people who want to have their own Web Site and publishing this Web Site, one has the chance to dynamically change the content of the site with the help of Airtable and Raindrop from the outside. It is a simple but functional site. I also did responsive design.
